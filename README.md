# Spring Boot Application with PostgreSQL Database

My first (working) Spring Boot application with PostgreSQL database.

In order to run the application, you need a PostgreSQL database installed & running locally with the following properties:
- the default username is `postgres`;
- the default password for the default username is `postgres`;
- the process is listening on the default PostgreSQL port `5432`;
- an empty database called `testdb`.
