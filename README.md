# Spring Boot Application with PostgreSQL Database

My first (working) Spring Boot application with PostgreSQL database.

The present project follows slavishly the [this tutorial](http://zetcode.com/springboot/postgresql/), therefore I claim no credit about the code here contained. 

The present repository is just a test of some code that I found surfing the Web and that I consider useful.

In order to run the application, you need a PostgreSQL database installed & running locally with the following properties:
- the default username is `postgres`;
- the default password for the default username is `postgres`;
- the process is listening on the default PostgreSQL port `5432`;
- an empty database called `testdb`.
